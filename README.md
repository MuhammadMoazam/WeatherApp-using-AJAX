# WeatherApp-using-AJAX

### Description
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In simpler terms, it's a technique that allows web pages to communicate with servers without having to reload the entire page. This makes websites feel more responsive and dynamic, like modern web applications.

### Benefits of AJAX:

1. No more waiting for full page reloads!
2. Real-time updates, live search, chat applications, and more become possible.
3. Only necessary data is transferred, saving resources.

### Live Examples:

1. Live Search:
    As you type in a search bar, results update dynamically without reloading the page. (e.g., Google Search, Amazon search)
3. Social Media Feeds:
    New posts update automatically without refreshing the page. (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)

### How to start
1. open the file in Visual Studio Code.
2. open terminal and write npm install.
3. after installation write npm start
